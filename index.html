                                <p>In May of 2014, BE A CHAMPION, INC. was awarded as a Contracting Entity/Sponsor with the Texas Department of Agriculture to provide the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). These programs are designed to provide nutritious snacks and meals to students participating in enrichment programs across Texas. BE A CHAMPION, INC. supports these programs with after-school enrichment programs and staff. Snacks and meals consist of all natural, fresh ingredients with no preservatives provided by our partner, Revolution Foods, Inc. At-Risk CACFP snacks and meals can be served if: -At least 50% of your school location is approved for free and reduced lunch for all youth up to 18 years of age. -Schools, community centers, day care centers, apartments and churches are all qualified locations for service. Though the Champion Fuel Food Program, students perform better in school as they consume healthy, fresh, well-balanced meals each day along with homework assistance and after-school enrichment programs. We currently server approximately 10,000 meals a day. For more information, please visit the Texas Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Programs at</p>
